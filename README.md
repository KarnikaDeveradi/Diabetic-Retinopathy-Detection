**Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Grad-CAM++** is a deep learning-based web application for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. It emphasizes **transparent AI** by combining high-performance classification using **EfficientNet-B5** with **Grad-CAM++** for visual explainability.

This project is inspired by the need for early, accurate, and explainable DR screening — especially in under-resourced clinical settings.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔬 **Deep Learning Classification**: EfficientNet-B5 trained on retinal fundus images to detect DR severity.
- 🔍 **Explainable AI**: Grad-CAM++ heatmaps to show *why* the model makes its prediction.
- 🌐 **Web Application**: Upload an image and instantly get prediction, confidence, and a visualization.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: t-SNE plots and confidence scores for transparency.
- 💻 **Modern UI**: Built with Flask, Bootstrap, AOS animations, and particles.js for a smooth experience.

## 📦 Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dishant-Chouhan/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-with-Gradcampp.git
   cd Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-with-Gradcamppp

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:

   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate         # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate            # For Windows
   
3. **Install Required Packages**:

   Make sure you're in the project root directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Download the model**:
    [Download best_model.pth](https://huggingface.co/thor15/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-with-Gradcampp/blob/main/best_model.pth)


5. **Run the Flask Web App**:

   Launch the application locally using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
 6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
